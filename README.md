## 1.1. What is it?

This is the file deletion batch written in Java and licensed under the Apache License 2.0.</br>
The user can set detailed conditions for files to be deleted, and the batch deletion process will be fast and safe based on the defined rules.

## 1.2. Motivation

1. Automate the deletion of files that tend to accumulate without being used, such as log files.
2. The program executes the deletion periodically according to the rules without human intervention.
3. General-purpose deletion processing in both horizontal and vertical directions independent of directory structure.
