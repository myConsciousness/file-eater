## 1.1. What is it?

This batch application resides in the background and periodically deletes files according to the file deletion rules defined by the user.

## 1.2. Motivation

1. Automate the deletion of files that tend to accumulate without being used, such as log files.

2. The program executes the deletion periodically according to the rules without human intervention.

3. General-purpose deletion processing in both horizontal and vertical directions independent of directory structure.
